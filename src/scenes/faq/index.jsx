        <AccordionDetails>
          <Typography>
          The ball costs 5 cents. The bat costs $1.05. Many people answer too quickly and say that the ball costs 10 cents. However, if that were true, and the bat costs $1 more than the ball, then the bat would have to cost $1.10, making the total cost $1.20.
